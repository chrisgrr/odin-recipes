    <h2>Moroccan Chicken Tagine</h2>
    
    <p>This Moroccan chicken tagine may be the best lemon chicken recipe of all
    time. Though it is not strictly a tagine, because it is not cooked in a 
    tagine, it has all the elements—preserved lemon, green olives, saffron—you 
    will find in the traditional recipe.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <h4>Marinade</h4>

    <ul>
      <li>1/4 tsp. saffron threads</li>
      <li>1/2 cup chicken broth or water</li>
      <li>1 preserved lemon</li>
      <li>3 garlic cloves, peeled, crushed</li>
      <li>1 tsp. kosher salt</li>
      <li>1/4 tsp. freshly ground black pepper</li>
      <li>2 tsp. paprika</li>
      <li>1 tsp. ground cumin</li>
      <li>1 tsp. ground ginger</li>
      <li>1/2 tsp. Aleppo chili flakes</li>
      <li>1/4 cup chopped fresh parsley</li>
      <li>1/4 cup fresh cilantro</li>
      <li>2 tbsp. olive oil</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Tagine</h4>

    <ul>
      <li>2 tbsp. olive oil</li>
      <li>6 chicken thighs, with skin</li>
      <li>1 large, yellow onion, diced</li>
      <li>1/4 tsp. kosher salt</li>
      <li>1/8 tsp. ground cinnamon</li>
      <li>1/8 tsp. ground turmeric</li>
      <li>1 cup pitted green olives, halved</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>

    <ol>
      <li>Combine saffron threads with boiling hot chicken broth or water in a
      small bowl; steep until cooled to room temperature, 20 to 30 minutes.</li>
      <li>Cut preserved lemon into quarters. Use a small knife to trim the flesh
      from the peel. Remove and discard any seeds, and finely chop the flesh.
      Transfer into a small bowl; reserve until needed. Slice each piece of
      peel in half to make 8 strips total; reserve until needed.</li>
      <li>To prepare chicken for marinating, make 2 cuts into the skin side of
      each thigh, down to the bone, about 1 inch apart. Transfer chicken into a
      resealable plastic bag; place bag in a bowl to catch any leakage.</li>
      <li>For marinade, add finely chopped preserved lemon flesh into a bowl;
      add garlic, salt, black pepper, paprika, cumin, ginger, Aleppo chili
      flakes, parsley, cilantro and olive oil. Pour in steeped saffron liquid
      and whisk thoroughly until emulsified.</li>
      <li>Pour marinade into the bag of chicken thighs. Massage chicken with
      your hands on the outside of the bag until evenly coated with marinade.
      Squeeze out any air and seal the bag tightly. Marinate in the refrigerator
      for 3 to 12 hours, turning bag over and massaging occasionally.</li>
      <li>Carefully remove chicken thighs to a plate and scrape any excess
      marinade back into the bag while doing so. Reserve excess marinade for
      sauce.</li>
      <li>Heat 2 tablespoons olive oil over medium-high heat in a heavy-duty
      braising pan, or other type of pan with a tight-fitting lid. Once hot,
      place the chicken in, skin side down. Cook for about 5 minutes, or until
      the skin is browned, and fat has rendered. The skin may stick and tear,
      but that will not affect the final dish. Turn off heat; remove chicken to
      a plate and reserve.</li>
      <li>Turn heat back up to medium-high, and add onion, salt, cinnamon, and
      turmeric to the pan. Cook, stirring for a few minutes, or until onions
      turn translucent and start to soften. Place chicken thighs back in, skin
      side up, and pour over any juices from the plate. Distribute the reserved
      excess marinade over the top of chicken.</li>
      <li>As soon as juices in the bottom of the pan start to bubble, cover
      tightly, and reduce heat to low. Cook, covered, for 1 hour.</li>
      <li>Uncover pan, and baste chicken with cooking liquid. Scatter green
      olives and reserved lemon peel over the top, and baste again.</li>
      <li>Cover; cook until chicken is very tender and will easily pull away
      from the bone, 15 to 20 minutes more.</li>
      <li>Raise heat up to medium-high, and cook, uncovered, to reduce the
      cooking liquid until slightly thickened, about 5 minutes. The sauce can be
      left thin and brothy, or cooked further to reduce to a glaze, or anywhere
      in between.</li>
      <li>Garnish with fresh parsley, cilantro sprigs, and another dusting of
      chili flakes.</li>
    </ol>
